        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 8, 2026</p>

        <p>We respect the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and

            Privacy Policy carefully. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT
                ACCESS THE APPLICATION.</strong></p>

        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you
            about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to
            periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made
            aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy
            by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the
            Application or make payments. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p><strong>File Zipper does NOT collect any personally identifiable information.</strong> The app is designed to
            work entirely offline and all file operations are performed locally on your device.</p>

            <li>Temporary cache files created during compression/extraction processes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Your files and personal content never leave your device and are not transmitted to any
                servers.</strong></p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app does use the following third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>

            <li>Anonymous analytics data (no personally identifiable information)</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
